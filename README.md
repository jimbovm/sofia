# Sofia

Sofia ~~is~~ _will be_ a cross-platform GUI application for working with the level data of 1985's most popular platform game. It uses [Isobel](https://github.com/jimbovm/isobel) as its backend.

Sofia is open source, licensed under a public domain-equivalent MIT-0 licence (see `LICENCE.md` for terms) and implemented in Kotlin for the Java Virtual Machine, so it will run anywhere.

## Build instructions

Execute in the root of the cloned repository:

./gradlew build
```

To build a portable "fat jar" with all dependencies included:

./gradlew fatJar
```

## âš  Warning 

Sofia is currently _pre-alpha_ software, incomplete and not ready for general use.
